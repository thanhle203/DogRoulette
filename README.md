## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

**It was a bit challenging to get the fetch api to work and map through the items inside the returned data. It took me a bit to figure out and once I finally figured that out, I got stuck on trying to re-fetch the data if the banned attribute was in the data. I was able to solve it using recursion though.**
